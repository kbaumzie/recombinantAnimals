        <div class="mt-5">
          <p>
            This project is intended for anyone with a high school level biology education. The main purpose is to educate people on the usage of animals
            in biotechnology and specifically genetically modified proteins and organisms.<br /><br />
            Within the past two decades DNA has been genetically modified, known as recombinant DNA, to help with further genome discoveries, assist with
            medical needs in humans such as insulin producers, and help with bodily regulation. In order to uncover all these discoveries, scientists rely
            on animals for testing of recombinant DNA to understand how it affects mammal biology, and how it can eventually help the human species combat
            disease and other abnormalities. The most popular way for scientists to derive information from animals is to genetically modify their genome.
            This can be completed in severals ways but the two most popular are:
            <ul>
              <li>Microinjection</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Clones modified DNA and injects it into a fertilized egg inside the uterus of an animal.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Retrovirus Infection</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Infecting a cell inside an organism to contain a genome altering virus with the proper encoded DNA and RNA.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br />
            After an animal (or other organism) is genetically modified (GMO), their bodies respond to the genome changes and scientists analyze these reactions.
            The parts of the animal and their byproducts that are used in this bioscience are:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>Milk: holds most of the reconstructive proteins and enzymes</li>
              <li>Urine</li>
              <li>Offspring</li>
              <li>Blood: Molecular Composition (usually after ingesting GMO foods)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            After scientists have used the animals for their studies, the animals are typically slaughtered immediately. This is done for many different reasons--
            contamination, mutations, poor heath, etc--and thus, the animal sacrifices their life for science! Common animals used for this type of biological testing
            are mice, cattle, and poultry. Scientists use animals as the "test dummies" to make sure this technology is safe to use for humans. All the genetically
            modified foods you would pick out in the grocery store have been fed to animals long before making it to your shopping cart. Even down to the insulin
            diabetic patients inject on a daily basis, that has been tested through animals before coming to the medical market.
